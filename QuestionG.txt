Answer :

Multi-Tenant Database Implementation in MongoDB :
One of the most challenging and rewarding pieces of code I’ve written is implementing a multi-tenant database architecture in MongoDB for a project management system (Featureflow).

Problem Statement:
------------------
In large organizations, multiple companies use the same platform, but their data must remain isolated while allowing efficient access. A multi-tenant system ensures each organization has its own separate data while using the same application.

Solution Approach:
-----------------
I implemented database-level multi-tenancy by dynamically selecting the correct database based on the organization. 
Each organization has its own separate database. 
When a user logs in, their organization ID determines which database to connect to.
This ensures data isolation while keeping the system scalable.

Key Implementation:
-------------------

Used MongoDB’s dynamic connection handling to switch databases at runtime.
Stored organization details in a master database to map users to their respective databases.
Optimized queries to ensure performance even with multiple databases.

Impact:
--------
Improved data security and scalability.
Allowed organizations to have their own isolated data without requiring separate application instances.
Helped in efficient resource utilization by using a shared application layer.
This feature significantly improved Featureflow’s architecture and made it a scalable solution for large enterprises like TCS and Infosys.
